wiper.sh-3.1
	- updated contrib/raid1ext4trim.sh script to v1.4, courtesy of Chris Caputo
	- new flag to enable unattended operation, and handle SIGPIPE
	- basic compatibility with latest Redhat/Fedora systems that lack the rdev command
	- support hfsplus and ntfs filesystem types, courtesy of Heiko Wegeler
	- hfsplus/ntfs notes from Heiko Wegeler:

	n-7 tests from a kvm installation: ok: "ntfs" raw ssd attached as 2nd drive,
	copy sleuthkit source files with w7 on a 100MB gpt partition. from linux
	compiletest, w7-chkdsk after trim ok "ntfs 8k cluster" same test ok: "ntfs with
	compressed files" same test ok: "ntfs with encrypted files" raw ssd attached as
	2nd drive, chkdsk after trim on a 100MB gpt partition. compiletest and chkdsk
	after unencryption and trim

	macos 10.4.5 from 2/2006 secret tests from the macos-installer (in kvm) with
	this wiper 2.5 patched with loopdevice, hfsplus,ntfs support (because attaching
	my raw boot ssd to macos is too risky for me) ok: fstype "mac os extended
	(journaled)" ssd partition sda7 100MB attached as 2nd disk then format, copy
	sleuthkit source files, quit installer. then from linux trim, mount readonly
	(formatted with macos needs a "force" option for readwrite, normal), copy files
	back to btrfs  for compile, works. verify disk with the macos installer, works
	ok: fstype "mac os extended" same test ok: fstype "mac os extended (case
	sensitive, journaled)"  same test ok: fstype "mac os extended (case sensitive)"
	same test ok: fstype "mac os standard" wiper says:offline TRIM not supported
	for hfs filesystems, aborting.  ok: fstype "unix file system" wiper says:
	offline TRIM not supported for ufs filesystems, aborting.  not tested: "msdos
	filesystem" and raids

	other checks in the source:
	* check if filesystem is properly unmounted sleuthkit checks and messages:
	* check for fsstat, which is only in sleuthkit. a outdated icat is in debian
	* package tct, the right icat is a link in package sleuthkit to
	* ->/etc/alternatives/icat->/usr/bin/icat-sleuthkit. ubuntu 10.4 LTS needs a
	* local build sleuthkit in /usr/local/bin because ubuntu lts sleuthkit is too
	* old.ubuntu 10.10 works with distribution package, fedora14 has /usr/bin/icat
	* from sleuthkit 3.1.1 and works, fedora13+updates should work (exept rdev)
	* other exit clauses which will never happen
