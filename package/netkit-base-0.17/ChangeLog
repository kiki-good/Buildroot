24-Jul-2000:
	Don't use OPEN_MAX. (Olaf Kirch)

23-Jul-2000:
	General audit for setuid/setgid/initgroups/etc. calls that didn't
	  check for error.

22-Jul-2000:
	Documented the virtual hosting stuff in inetd(8).
	  (Michael Tokarev, mjt@tls.msk.ru)
	
	On systems where sleep() is implemented in terms of alarm(),
	  inetd breaks because it tries to sleep while alarms are in
	  progress, blocks SIGALRM, and other fun stuff. So, on libc5,
	  reimplement sleep in terms of select to circumvent this.

	Fixed another file descriptor leak. (Pekka Savola, 
	  Pekka.Savola@netcore.fi)

	Added code that will hopefully restart inetd if it runs out of
	  fds. It doesn't work terribly well yet, unfortunately.

3-Jun-2000:
	Some minor fixes to ping.

4-Feb-2000:
	Massive cleanup of ping. 
	Also, added -w option (overall timeout).

3-Feb-2000:
	Merge some ping fixes from Red Hat.

20-Jan-2000:
	AF_UNIX sockets should be chmod 666'd after being bound.
	  (Olaf Kirch, okir@caldera.de)

14-Dec-1999:
	netkit-base-0.16 is released.

12-Dec-1999:
	Split off rpcgen and rpcinfo into netkit-rpc.

23-Nov-1999:
	Log the pid along with the service name when it fails (exits
	  nonzero or with a signal.)
	  (Catalin Mitrofan, catam@infoiasi.ro)

	
14-Sep-1999:
	Have inetd discard a bunch of well-known environment variables
	  at startup, in case someone starts it from a shell and doesn't
	  use "env -".
	Fix ping to behave itself when flooding localhost.
	Deny ping -s (give packet size) to non-root users, as it has
	  little purpose beyond DoS.

23-Aug-1999:
	Merged the virtual hosting stuff. The syntax in inetd.conf
	  is "service@host" as the first field, instead of just "service".
	  You can use hostnames, not just IP addresses. Note however 
	  that you can't mix "service" with "service@host" for the same
	  service - it won't be able to bind both sockets.
	  (Martin Lucina, mato@Pod-Palmou.drp.fmph.uniba.sk; Philip 
	  Copeland, root@ftp.uk.linux.org; David A. Holland, 
	  dholland@hcs.harvard.edu, et al.)

22-Aug-1999:
	Major cleanup of inetd. Minor DoS fixed. New option -i for running
	  from init. Won't exec programs with argc==0. Completely new
	  config parser, too, but it's still fairly gross - is there any
	  reason not to use lex? (dholland@hcs.harvard.edu)

1-Aug-1999:
	Complete y2k and y2038 audit.
	  (dholland@hcs.harvard.edu)

31-Jul-1999:
	Redo makefiles/config stuff for new confgen version.
	Don't build rpcinfo with glibc; glibc also includes rpcinfo.
	  (dholland@hcs.harvard.edu)

31-Jul-1999:
	Fix 64-bit issues in ping.
	  (Alex Rhomberg, rhomberg@ife.ee.ethz.ch)

15-Jul-1999:
	Merge the old sample-etc-files package into netkit-base, where it
	  more or less belongs. (dholland@hcs.harvard.edu)
	
9-Jul-1999:
	Make sure ping's raw socket doesn't end up as stdout/stderr.
	  (I thought this had been merged ages ago...)
	  (dholland@hcs.harvard.edu)

7-Apr-1999: 
	Merged fd leak patch into CVS tree; fixed a related bug with
	  "tcp wait" services (which, fortunately, nobody uses) and an
	  fd leak in the #if'd-out identd query code.
	  (dholland@hcs.harvard.edu)

29-Jul-1998:
	File descriptor leak patched in. Patch by Astor-> Chris
	  (Chris Evans chris@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk)

23-Sep-1997:
	Fix missing {} in inetd that led to excess calls of sleep().
	  (D. Richard Hipp, drh@acm.org)

22-Sep-1997:
	Fix a strncpy() misuse bug in ping, and others in inetd.
	Reject udp source ports lower than 128 in inetd services to
	  prevent a single spoofed packet from triggering a local udp
	  storm. (Willy TARREAU, tarreau@aemiaif.ibp.fr)

20-Aug-1997:
	Fixed minor doc bug in inetd.8.

14-Jul-1997:
	Fixed bug in inetd where two entries in /etc/inetd.conf for the
	  same service would confuse it.

12-Jun-1997:
	netkit-base-0.10 released.

19-May-1997:
	glibc fixes from Red Hat.

13-May-1997:
	Fixes for record-route in ping. (Dave Smart, 
	  dsmart@nastg.gsfc.nasa.gov)

12-May-1997:
	Merged inetd, ping, and rpc packages together to form "base".

05-Apr-1997:
	Added configure script to generate MCONFIG.
	Don't build rpcgen if glibc is in use, since glibc has its own.

08-Mar-1997: 
	Split from full NetKit package. 
	Generated this change log from NetKit's.

07-Mar-1997:
	Fix rpcgen bug and redo suppression of unused variable warnings.
	  (Frank Heldt, heldt.mahr@t-online.de)
	Fixed group handling in inetd in case it's run manually.
	Ignore SIGPIPE in inetd to prevent denial of service.
	Posixized signal handling in inetd. (Gerald Britton, 
	  gbritton@whitman.gmu.edu)

29-Dec-1996
	NetKit-0.09 released.
	Ping exits with code 1 if it gets no response. (Donnie Barnes,
	  djb@redhat.com)
	Assorted alpha/glibc patches. (Erik Troan, ewt@redhat.com)
	Assorted bug fixes from Debian. (Peter Tobias, 
	  tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de)
	Hardened programs against DNS h_length spoofing attacks.
	Use inet_aton() everywhere instead of inet_addr().
	inetd now supports a -q option to set the socket listen queue length.
	Minor hacks to rpcgen to cause it to generate code that 
	  compiles more cleanly.
	Fix bug in -N rpcgen output. (Frank Heldt, heldt.mahr@t-online.de)
	Fix to ping to avoid an endless sleep problem on links that can
	  corrupt packets. (Yury Shevchuk, sizif@botik.ru)
	ping understands new RFC1812 ICMP dest unreachable codes. (Alan Cox)
	ping drops root after startup, but (theoretically) only when 
	  it's known to be safe to do so. (Alan Cox)

22-Aug-1996
	NetKit-B-0.08 released.
	rpcgen now puts some standard includes in its generated c.
	(almost) everything now compiles with lots of warnings turned on.
	ping -l (preload flood) requires uid 0.
	ping sets SO_BROADCAST so pinging the broadcast address works.
	Clear environment in setuid programs to protect against library
	bugs.

25-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07A released.

23-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07 released.
	Integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
	  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
	Major security fixes, including to fingerd, lpr, rlogin, rsh, talkd, 
	  and telnetd. Do *not* use the sliplogin from earlier versions of this
	  package, either.
	Much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
	Massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc
	  -Wall now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix
	  this would be appreciated if anyone feels like it.
	New maintainer:  David A. Holland, dholland@hcs.harvard.edu
