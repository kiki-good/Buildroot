inetd:
	- If you switch a service to vhosting, you have to kill -1 twice.
	  This is because it adds the new services in (and thus tries to
	  bind the sockets) before it flushes the old ones, so the binds
	  fail the first time.

	- Someone with detailed knowledge of the behavior of file 
	  descriptor limits in the kernel (particularly over changing
	  kernel versions) should look at the rlimit code and see if it
	  makes sense and if it interacts with the restart-on-EMFILE 
	  code correctly. It gives an air of being wrong.

	- setproctitle() may produce a "might be used uninitialized"
	  warning.

	- If you encounter problems with inetd disabling services and
	  then never restarting them, or (rarely) hanging completely
	  in sigpause or sigsuspend, the most likely problem is that
	  your libc is doing sleep() by calling alarm() followed by
	  sigsuspend(). This conflicts with inetd's use of alarm() and
	  causes all kinds of problems. To solve this problem, put
	  -DUSE_MYSLEEP in CFLAGS. (This is already the default for
	  libc5.) If someone can think of a clever way to test for
	  this condition in configure without making configure take a
	  long time to run, please let me know.

ping:
	- lets any user view arbitrary incoming icmp traffic.
