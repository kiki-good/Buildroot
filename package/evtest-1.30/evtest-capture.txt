EVTEST-CAPTURE(1)
=================

NAME
----

     evtest-capture - Input device event capture program

SYNOPSIS
--------
     evtest-capture "/dev/input/eventX" [evtest-capture.xml]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
evtest-capture captures the information and events from the input device
specified on the command line and writes it to the xml file given. If no
filename is given for the output file, evtest-capture.xml is chosen as
default.

evtest-capture needs to be able to read from the device; in most cases this means it
must be run as root.

Together with with evtest-create-device.xsl, a simple uinput-based software
input device can be created that replays the events as if the same input was
performed on the physical device. This can be useful to replicate bugs with
input devices in upper layers of the stack.

To convert evtest-capture.xml into such a uinput device, run:

     xsltproc evtest-create-device.xls evtest-capture.xml > mydevice.c
     gcc -o mydevice mydevice.c
     ./mydevice


DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
If evtest-capture does not see any events even though the device is being
used, the device may be grabbed by a process (EVIOCGRAB).  This is usually the
case when debugging a synaptics device from within X. VT switching to a TTY or
shutting down the X server terminates this grab and synaptics devices can be
debugged.
