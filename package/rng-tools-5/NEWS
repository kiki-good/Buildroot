Version 5 (April 1, 2014):
* Support RDRAND capable systems that don't have AES-NI
* Man page spelling fixes
* Add BUGS document
* Don't use fixed AES key for data reduction
* Platform: Support x32. x86-64 micro-optimizations.
* Fix RDRAND data reduction
* Enable RDSEED instruction

Version 4 (August 2, 2012):
* Add RDRAND instruction support
* Add -q and -v options for quiet and verbose output
* Add -p option for specifying PID file (text file containing daemon's PID)
* Disable entropy source if facing continued failures, but be
  tolerant of the occasional fault.
* Default device is now the preferred /dev/hwrng
* Do not use TPM device for RNG access, if /dev/hwrng is present
  (TPM RNG is exported via the kernel, in newer kernels)

Version 3 (July 3, 2010):

* add rngtest program
* imported into git repository
* support TPM chip's hardware RNG (and thus, a framework for supporting
  multiple entropy sources)
* change default hardware RNG device name to "/dev/hw_random"

Version 2 (August 24, 2004):

* Fixes and cleanups from Debian (Henrique de Moraes Holschuh)
  Assures rngd works with 2.6 kernels.

Version 1.1 (April 6, 2004):

* update to recent autoconf/automake
* add new rngtest program
* various minor cleanups
* much better FIPS testing
