rcp:
	- should call rsh instead of using root
	- pukes on files in /proc
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

rlogin: 
	- should use sigaction
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

rsh:
	- should try rexec if rcmd doesn't work
	- should warn that the connection isn't encrypted

rexecd:
	- apparently the anti-portscanning fix (rcs rev 1.12 -> 1.13) 
	  causes rexecd to not work with some or all rexec clients.
