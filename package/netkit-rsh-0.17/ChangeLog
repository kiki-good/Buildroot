	General audit for setuid/setgid/initgroups/etc. calls that didn't
	  check for error.

	Other PAM changes in rlogind. (Jeff Johnson, jbj@redhat.com,
	  munged by yours truly.)

17-Dec-1999:
	Fix bug in rshd (hangs forever with zombie offspring).
	Also fix problems with rlogind.

	Redid makefiles/config stuff for new confgen version.

3-Mar-1999:

	(I trust distributing this in netkit is ok; if not, it'll go away.)

22-Sep-1997:
	Clear crypt()'s internal state as well as the cleartext password.
	At least, hopefully.

27-Jul-1997:

29-Dec-1996
	NetKit-0.09 released.
	Assorted alpha/glibc patches. (Erik Troan, ewt@redhat.com)
	Assorted bug fixes from Debian. (Peter Tobias, 
	  tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de)
	Hardened programs against DNS h_length spoofing attacks.
	Use inet_aton() everywhere instead of inet_addr().
	Rudimentary shadow support in rexecd.
	Moved opening of stderr in rexecd after authentication so you
	  can't do port scans with it.
	rlogind no longer gets mixed up when NIS or PAM does resolver
	  operations.
        rlogind now supports a -h option to permit root rhosts files
	  (which are not honored by default) and a -L option to disable 
	  all rhosts and hosts.equiv processing.
	rshd now supports the -h option also. To achieve the equivalent of 
	  rlogind's -L option, disable rshd entirely.
	Fix select problems in rsh. (Felix Egli, fegli@goldnet.ch)

	bugs.

23-Jul-1996
	NetKit-B-0.07 released.
	Integrated a collection of patches that had been lurking on the net,
	  including the 256-ptys support for telnetd and passive mode ftp.
	Major security fixes, including to fingerd, lpr, rlogin, rsh, talkd, 
	  and telnetd. Do *not* use the sliplogin from earlier versions of this
	  package, either.
	Much of the code builds without libbsd.a or bsd includes.
	Massive code cleanup. Almost everything compiles clean with gcc
	  -Wall now. rusers and rusersd do not; patches to rpcgen to fix
	  this would be appreciated if anyone feels like it.
	Kerberos support has been removed. It didn't work anyway, and
	  proper Kerberos tools come with Kerberos.
	Added experimental support for PAM (Pluggable Authentication
	  Modules) which may or may not actually work...
	New maintainer:  David A. Holland, dholland@hcs.harvard.edu

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.06 released.
	rsh was exiting before all of the output from the remote command
	  was finished. This only happened together with Solaris machines,
	  not SunOS 4.1.
	  (Mark Weaver Mark_Weaver@brown.edu)
	  Could you all please give rsh a very hard test?

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.05 released.
	Fixed writing entries to /var/adm/wtmp by ftpd, rlogind and
	  telnetd. (logwtmp.c) Florian
	  This is only necessary for the GNU last, not for the one 
	  in util-linux...
	Changed rsh to stop looking for options after the first
	  non-option. (See POSIXLY_CORRECT environment and "+" as first
	  option for GNU getopt.)

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.04 released.

date not known
	NetKit-B-0.03 released.
	I found a bug-fix on of the news groups by Ulf Rimkus
	  ulf@pc0435.psychologie.uni-marburg.de. 'rexecd' didn't set the
	  environment at all. (Though it prepares all data for it...)
