	bool "collectd"
	help
	Collectd is a daemon which collects system 
	performance statistics periodically and provides 
	mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways.
	collectd gathers statistics about the system it is running on 
	and stores this information. Those statistics can then be used to 
	find current performance analysis and predict 
	future system load (i.e. capacity planning).
