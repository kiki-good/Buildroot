Sample XML Signatures[1] using the revised XPath Filter 2.0[2]

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/
[2] Were it considered, the URL would be http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-filter2/
    but in the meantime it is attached to the accompanying message

First, the last example from the spec along with an example of
an empty input node set:

  sign-spec.tmpl - A basic signature template
  sign-spec.xml - The signature
  sign-spec-c14n-*.txt - C14n output

Next, John Boyer's example (for performance testing):

  sign-xfdl.tmpl - The signature template
  sign-xfdl.xml - The signature
  sign-xfdl-c14n-*.txt - C14n output
