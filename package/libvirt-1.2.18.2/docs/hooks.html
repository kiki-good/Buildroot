        </h2>
        <p>Beginning with libvirt 0.8.0, specific events on a host system will
       trigger custom scripts.</p>
        <p>These custom <b>hook</b> scripts are executed when any of the following
       actions occur:</p>
        <ul><li>The libvirt daemon starts, stops, or reloads its
          configuration
          (<span class="since">since 0.8.0</span>)<br /><br /></li><li>A QEMU guest is started or stopped
         (<span class="since">since 0.8.0</span>)<br /><br /></li><li>An LXC guest is started or stopped
         (<span class="since">since 0.8.0</span>)<br /><br /></li><li>A network is started or stopped or an interface is
          plugged/unplugged to/from the network
          (<span class="since">since 1.2.2</span>)<br /><br /></li></ul>

          <a class="headerlink" href="#location" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>
        </h2>
        <p>The libvirt hook scripts are located in the directory
       <code>$SYSCONFDIR/libvirt/hooks/</code>.</p>
        <ul><li>In Linux distributions such as Fedora and RHEL, this is
          <code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/</code>.  Other Linux distributions may do
          this differently.</li><li>If your installation of libvirt has instead been compiled from
          source, it is likely to be
          <code>/usr/local/etc/libvirt/hooks/</code>.</li></ul>
        <p>To use hook scripts, you will need to create this <code>hooks</code>
       directory manually, place the desired hook scripts inside, then make
       them executable.</p>
        <br />

        </h2>
        <p>At present, there are three hook scripts that can be called:</p>
        <ul><li><code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon</code><br /><br />
          Executed when the libvirt daemon is started, stopped, or reloads
          its configuration<br /><br /></li><li><code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu</code><br /><br />
          Executed when a QEMU guest is started, stopped, or migrated<br /><br /></li><li><code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/lxc</code><br /><br />
          Executed when an LXC guest is started or stopped</li><li><code>/etc/libvirt/hooks/network</code><br /><br />
          Executed when a network is started or stopped or an
          interface is plugged/unplugged to/from the network</li></ul>
        <br />

          <a name="structure" shape="rect" id="structure">Script structure</a>
          <a class="headerlink" href="#structure" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>
        </h2>
        <p>The hook scripts are executed using standard Linux process creation
       functions.  Therefore, they must begin with the declaration of the
       command interpreter to use.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">#!/bin/bash</pre>
        <p>or:</p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">#!/usr/bin/python</pre>
        <p>Other command interpreters are equally valid, as is any executable
       binary, so you are welcome to use your favourite languages.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>
          <a name="arguments" shape="rect" id="arguments">Script arguments</a>
          <a class="headerlink" href="#arguments" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>
        </h2>
        <p>The hook scripts are called with specific command line arguments,
       depending upon the script, and the operation being performed.</p>
        <p>The guest hook scripts, qemu and lxc, are also given the <b>full</b>
       XML description for the domain on their stdin. This includes items
       such the UUID of the domain and its storage information, and is
       intended to provide all the libvirt information the script needs.</p>
        <p>For all cases, stdin of the network hook script is provided with the
       full XML description of the network status in the following form:</p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;hookData&gt;
  &lt;network&gt;
     &lt;name&gt;$network_name&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;uuid&gt;afca425a-2c3a-420c-b2fb-dd7b4950d722&lt;/uuid&gt;
     ...
  &lt;/network&gt;
&lt;/hookData&gt;</pre>
        <p>In the case of an interface
       being plugged/unplugged to/from the network, the network XML will be
       followed with the full XML description of the domain containing the
       interface that is being plugged/unplugged:</p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;hookData&gt;
  &lt;network&gt;
     &lt;name&gt;$network_name&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;uuid&gt;afca425a-2c3a-420c-b2fb-dd7b4950d722&lt;/uuid&gt;
     ...
  &lt;/network&gt;
  &lt;domain type='$domain_type' id='$domain_id'&gt;
     &lt;name&gt;$domain_name&lt;/name&gt;
     &lt;uuid&gt;afca425a-2c3a-420c-b2fb-dd7b4950d722&lt;/uuid&gt;
     ...
  &lt;/domain&gt;
&lt;/hookData&gt;</pre>
        <p>Please note that this approach is different from other cases such as
       <code>daemon</code>, <code>qemu</code> or <code>lxc</code> hook scripts,
       because two XMLs may be passed here, while in the other cases only a single
       XML is passed.</p>
        <p>The command line arguments take this approach:</p>
        <ol><li>The first argument is the name of the <b>object</b> involved in the
          operation, or '-' if there is none.<br /><br />
          For example, the name of a guest being started.<br /><br /></li><li>The second argument is the name of the <b>operation</b> being
          performed.<br /><br />
          For example, "start" if a guest is being started.<br /><br /></li><li>The third argument is a <b>sub-operation</b> indication, or '-' if there
          is none.<br /><br /></li><li>The last argument is an <b>extra argument</b> string, or '-' if there is
          none.</li></ol>

        <p>This translates to the following specifics for each hook script:</p>

          <pre xml:space="preserve">/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon - start - start</pre></li><li>When the libvirt daemon is shut down, this script is called as:<br />
          <pre xml:space="preserve">/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon - shutdown - shutdown</pre></li><li>When the libvirt daemon receives the SIGHUP signal, it reloads its
          configuration and triggers the hook script as:<br />
          <pre xml:space="preserve">/etc/libvirt/hooks/daemon - reload begin SIGHUP</pre></li></ul>
        <p>Please note that when the libvirt daemon is restarted, the <i>daemon</i>
       hook script is called once with the "shutdown" operation, and then once
       with the "start" operation.  There is no specific operation to indicate
       a "restart" is occurring.</p>
