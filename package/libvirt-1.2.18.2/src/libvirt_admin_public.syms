# Officially exported symbols, for which header

# Versions here are *fixed* to match the libvirt version
# at which the symbol was introduced. This ensures that
# a new client app requiring symbol foo() can't accidentally
# run with old libvirt-admin.so not providing foo() - the global
# soname version info can't enforce this since we never
# change the soname
