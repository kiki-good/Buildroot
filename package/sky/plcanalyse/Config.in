    This tool will analyse the PLC network, as seen by the local 
	device, and determine whether its peer devices are in adjacent 
	sockets, are in distant sockets and whether there is sufficient 
	noise,  within the PLC network, to cast doubt on the traffic 
	through-put rates which could be achieved.
