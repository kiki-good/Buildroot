/**
 * job_process_start:
 *
 * @job: job context for process to be run in,
 * @process: job process to run.
 *
 * This function looks up @process in the job's process table and uses
 * the information there to spawn a new process for the @job, storing the
 * pid in that table entry.
 *
 * The process is normally executed using the system shell, unless the
 * script member of @process is FALSE and there are no typical shell
 * characters within the command member, in which case it is executed
 * directly using exec after splitting on whitespace.
 *
 * When executed with the shell, if the command (which may be an entire
 * script) is reasonably small (less than 1KB) it is passed to the
 * shell using the POSIX-specified -c option.  Otherwise the shell is told
 * to read commands from one of the special /proc/self/fd/NN devices and NihIo
 * used to feed the script into that device.  A pointer to the NihIo object
 * is not kept or stored because it will automatically clean itself up should
 * the script go away as the other end of the pipe will be closed.
 *
 * In either case the shell is run with the -e option so that commands will
 * fail if their exit status is not checked.
 *
 * This function will only block on temporary job_process_spawn_with_fd() error
 * (for example fork() failure): in normal operation it returns as soon as
 * the fork() was successful, registering an NihIo which provides
 * asynchronous handling of the child setup stage. The specified error
 * handler will be called should child setup fail.
 *
 * It is up to the caller to decide whether non-temporary errors are a reason
 * to change the job state or not.

 * job_process_spawn_with_fd:

 * @trace: whether to trace this process,
 * @script_fd: script file descriptor,
 * @process: job process to spawn,
 * @job_process_fd: readable child setup pipe file descriptor.
 *
 * This function spawns a new process using the class details in @job to set up
 * the environment for it; the process is always a session and process group
 * leader as we never want anything in our own group.
 *
 * The process to be executed is given in the @argv array which is passed
 * directly to execvp(), so should be in the same NULL-terminated form with
 * the first argument containing the path or filename of the binary.  The
 * PATH environment in the @job's associated class will be searched.
 *
 * If @trace is TRUE, the process will be traced with ptrace and this will
 * cause the process to be stopped when the exec() call is made.  You must
 * wait for this and then may use it to set options before continuing the
 * process.
 *
 * If @script_fd is not -1, this file descriptor is dup()d to the special fd 9
 * (moving any other out of the way if necessary).
 *
 * This function only spawns the process, it is up to the caller to ensure
 * that the information is saved into the job and that the process is watched,
 * etc. Also, it is up to the caller to monitor @job_process_fd to
 * ensure the child setup was successful; data available to read
 * indicates a failure to setup the child environment (represented by a
 * JOB_PROCESS_ERROR error) whereas if the descriptor is simply
 * closed setup was successful and the caller can then mark the job
 * process as started.
 *
 * Spawning a process may fail for temporary reasons, usually due to a failure
 * of the fork() syscall.
 *
 * Returns: process id of new process on success, -1 on raised error
