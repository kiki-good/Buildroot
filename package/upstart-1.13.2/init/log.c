 * Notes for user jobs:
 *
 * User jobs by necessity are handled differently to system jobs. Since
 * a user job must log their data to files owned by a non-root user, the
 * safest technique is for a process running as that user to create the
 * log file. If we simply redirected the jobs standard streams, this
 * would be simple: the job process itself could write the files.
 * However, since we want to give the impression the job is connected to
 * a real terminal by using a pseudo-tty, we necessarily need "some
 * other" process to handle the jobs logging as the user in question.
 *
 * Since most jobs do not produce any output it would be highly
 * inefficient to spawn such a logger process as soon as every user job
 * starts. Therefore the approach taken is the lazy one: create a user
 * logger process _when the job first produces output_. To avoid
 * terrible performance this process will then hang around until the job
 * has finished.
 *
 * Note that only the initial amount of data read from a user job is
 * necessarily buffered within init itself. This initial amount is very
 * small due to the default applied by nih_io_watcher_read().
 * All subsequent job output is buffered within USER_LOGGER.

 *     most recent data will have been
 *     discarded).

 *     new data as unflushed (potentially unsafe
 *     - in low disk space situations, programs may
 *     produce *more* log messages to
 *     stdout/stderr).

 *     fixed value (ring buffer) What heuristic can
 *     we use to decide upon 'n'? Since this is

 *     gives a reasonable amount of context. However,
 *     if space later becomes available, there will
 *     be mysterious gaps in the log files.
 * (e) Discard all new data (not ideal, but safe)
 *
 * In the interests of self-preservation, we have to assume the
 * problem is *not* transitory and as such we opt for the safest
 * option, namely option 'e' since:
 *
 * - We cannot cache all data (option 'a') as it could
 *   result in a crash.
 * - Any other option which caches data will result in
 *   a corrupted log file should space later become
 *   available.
