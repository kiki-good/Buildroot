.SH NAME
upstart\-udev\-bridge \- Bridge between Upstart and udev
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upstart\-udev\-bridge
.RI [ OPTIONS ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B upstart\-udev\-bridge
receives information about kernel uevents that
.BR udev (8)
has completed and creates
.BR init (8)
events for them.

It emits events which match the pattern "\fIS\fP\-device\-\fIA\fP" where
\(aqS\(aq is the udev \fIsubsystem\fP and \(aqA\(aq is one of
\fIadded\fR, \fIchanged\fR or \fIremoved\fR,
which correspond to the past tense of the udev \(aqaction\(aq.

See \fBudev\fP(7) and for further details.

Assuming \fI/sys\fP is mounted, possible values for \fIsubsystem\fP for
your system are viewable via \fI/sys/class/\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.TP
.B \-\-daemon
Detach and run in the background.
.\"
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Enable debugging output.
.\"
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show brief usage summary.
.\"
.TP
.B \-\-no\-strip
Do not modify udev message contents. By default, all udev data will have
non-printable bytes removed. This option reverts the behaviour to not
modifying the data in any way. This option is not recommended since
specifying it
.I could
result in
.BR udev (7)
events not being emitted as Upstart events should any of your
hardware expose non-printable characters to the kernel. You can establish
whether this is happening by running
.I without
specifying this option
but with the 
.B \-\-debug
option.
.\"
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Enable verbose output.
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES

Some examples of Upstart events generated by this bridge:
.IP net\-device\-added
Event emitted when a network device is added.
.IP net\-device\-removed
Event emitted when a network device is removed.
.IP graphics\-device\-added
Event emitted when a graphics device is available to the system.
