/**
 * This is the Upstart File Bridge which allows jobs to react to files
 * being created, modified and deleted.
 *
 * = Design =
 *
 * This bridge creates inotify watches on the _first existing parent
 * directory_ for the file (normal or directory) being watched for. As
 * directories are created, the watch is moved to become more specific
 * (closer to the actually requested file path) and as directories are
 * deleted, the watch is correspondingly changed to a less specific, but
 * existing, directory.
 *
 * This is necessary since:
 *
 * - It conserves system resources.
 *
 *   There is little point creating 'n' watches on existing files when a
 *   single watch on the parent directory will suffice.
 *
 * - It is not possible to create an inotify watch for a non-existent
 *   entity (*).
 *
 * - In a sense, it simplifies the design.
 *
 *   Otherwise the bridge would have to put a watch on each existing
 *   file for modify and delete requests, but watch the parent for
 *   create requests. And for a combination of requests who share
 *   a parent directory, it's easier to just watch the parent alone.
 *
 * = Limitations =
 *
 * Since inotify is used, this bridge has a number of significant
 * limitations:
 *
 * 1) It cannot be anything but inherently racy.
 *
 * inotify(7) does not support recursive watches, so in some -- and not
 * necessarily pathological -- cases, events may be missed. This is
 * unfortunately exacerbated by the design of the bridge which creates
 * watches on the parent directory. This takes time, but in the window
 * when the watch is being created, files may have been modified
 * undetectably.
 *
 * For example, if the user requests a watch on '/var/log/app/foo.log',
 * the following might happen:
 *
 * (1) Watch is created for existing directory '/var/log/'.
 * (2) A process creates '/var/log/app/'.
 * (3) The bridge detects this and moves the watch from
 *     '/var/log/' to '/var/log/app/'.
 * (4) Whilst (3) is happening, some process removes '/var/log/app/'.
 * (5) The bridge now has an impotent watch on the now-deleted
 *     '/var/log/app/'.
 * (6) The app starts and (re-)creates '/var/log/app/'.
 * (7) The app now creates '/var/log/app/foo.log'.
 * (8) No event is emitted due to the impotent watch in (5).
 *
 * The situation is sadly actually worse than this: if a job watches for
 * a deep directory, if any one of the directory elements that is
 * created gets missed due to a race between the directory creation and
 * this bridge creating or moving a watch, the event will not be
 * emitted.
 *
 * = Advice =
 *
 * - Attempt to only watch for files to be created/modified/deleted
 *   in directories that are guaranteed to already exist at
 *   system startup. This avoids the racy behaviour between
 *   directory creation and inotify watch manipulation.
 *
 * - If the directory is not guaranteed to exist at system startup,
 *   create an Upstart job that creates the directory before the bridge
 *   starts ('start on starting upstart-file-bridge').
 *
 * = Alternative Approaches =
 *
 * fanotify is an alternative but again, it is limited:
 *
 * == Pros ==
 *
 * + Supports recursive watches.
 *
 * == Cons ==
 *
 * - Does not support a file delete event.
 *
 * - Potentially high system performance impact since _every_ file
 *   operation on the partition (except delete) is inspected.
 *
 *---------- 
 *
 * (*) - this is half true: inotify alarmingly does allow a watch to be
 * created on a non-existent entity, but is impotent - if that entity is
 * ever created, no event is received.
