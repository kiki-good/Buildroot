Unit Tests
==========

Upstarts unit tests are run via::

  make check

Integration Tests
=================

Python 3 scripts that make use of the ``pyupstart.py`` test module.
There are 2 classes of integration tests:

Session-level Integration Tests
-------------------------------

These can be run as a non-root user or as root. Ideally, run them as
both users.

To run the tests::

  $ cd scripts/tests && ./test_pyupstart_session_init.py

The tests make use of some of the sample Job Configuration (``.conf``)
files shipped with Upstart. However, if the
``UPSTART_TEST_USE_INSTALLED_CONF`` variable is set to any value, if the
tests find an *installed* session job of the same name, they will use
those jobs instead. The current sample jobs the tests use are:

- ``re-exec.conf``
- ``upstart-file-bridge.conf``

System-level Integration Tests
------------------------------

These tests must be run as ``root`` (the tests will be skipped if called
by a non-root user) and operate on the PID 1 executable. The tests will
create a subdirectory below ``/etc/init/`` in an attempt to isolate
themselves from the rest of the system. However, these tests are
designed to be run *on test systems only*.

The tests also exercise the chroot abilities of Upstart. If the
environment variable ``UPSTART_TEST_CHROOT_PATH`` is set and points to a
valid chroot in which Upstart is installed this chroot will participate
in the tests.

To run the system-level integration tests::

  $ su
  # export UPSTART_TEST_CHROOT_PATH=/full/path/to/chroot
  # cd scripts/tests && ./test_pyupstart_system_init.py

Running All the Tests Together
------------------------------

WARNING: Running the tests as ``root`` in this way will modify your
``/etc/init/`` directory. See `System-level Integration Tests`_.

You can make use of python3's unittest module to run all the tests in
the normal fashion:

  $ cd scripts && python3 -munittest
  $ su
  # cd scripts && python3 -munittest
