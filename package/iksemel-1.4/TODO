==> 1.5 release, abi/api compatible, will be released in a few months

* ssl layer abstraction, openssl/gnutls build option
* integrade python binding from pardus into the main tree
* parser: &#1234; and &#xA25F; like entities must be unescaped.
* xml pretty printer
* file stream based xml printer


==> 2.0 release, minor abi/api changes, hopefully in 2009 :)

* rewrite sax parser for better performance and correctness
* offer a high level jabber api for managing connection details
* input/output modules for encodings (utf8/16), compression (zlib,bzip2),
and source (file, memory, network stream).


==> ideas

* packet filter or a generic xml filter? something like a simplified xpath?
* a separate utf8 validator function can be useful
* utf8 <-> utf16 conversion functions can be useful


anything else? :-)
