.TH rpc.statd 8 "31 Aug 2004"
.SH NAME
rpc.statd \- NSM status monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "/sbin/rpc.statd [-F] [-d] [-?] [-n " name "] [-o " port "] [-p " port "] [-H " prog "] [-V]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B rpc.statd
server implements the NSM (Network Status Monitor) RPC protocol.
This service is somewhat misnamed, since it doesn't actually provide
active monitoring as one might suspect; instead, NSM implements a
reboot notification service. It is used by the NFS file locking service,
.BR rpc.lockd ,
to implement lock recovery when the NFS server machine crashes and
reboots.
.SS Operation
For each NFS client or server machine to be monitored,
.B rpc.statd
creates a file in
.BR /var/lib/nfs/sm .
When starting, it iterates through these files and notifies the
peer
.B rpc.statd
on those machines.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -F
By default,
.B rpc.statd
forks and puts itself in the background when started. The
.B -F
argument tells it to remain in the foreground. This option is
mainly for debugging purposes.
.TP
.B -d
By default,
.B rpc.statd
sends logging messages via
.BR syslog (3)
to system log.  The
.B -d
argument forces it to log verbose output to
.B stderr
instead. This option is mainly for debugging purposes, and may only
be used in conjunction with the
.B -F
parameter.
.TP
.BI "\-n," "" " \-\-name " name 
specify a name for
.B rpc.statd
to use as the local hostname. By default,
.BR rpc.statd
will call
.BR gethostname (2)
to get the local hostname. Specifying
a local hostname may be useful for machines with more than one
interfaces.
.TP
.BI "\-o," "" " \-\-outgoing\-port "  port
specify a port for
.B rpc.statd
to send outgoing status requests from.  By default,
.BR rpc.statd
will ask
.BR portmap (8)
to assign it a port number.  As of this writing, there is not
a standard port number that
.BR portmap
always or usually assigns.  Specifying
a port may be useful when implementing a firewall.
.TP
.BI "\-p," "" " \-\-port " port
specify a port for
.B rpc.statd
to listen on.  By default,
.BR rpc.statd
will ask
.BR portmap (8)
to assign it a port number.  As of this writing, there is not
a standard port number that
.BR portmap
always or usually assigns.  Specifying
a port may be useful when implementing a firewall.
.TP
.BI "\-P," "" " \-\-state\-directory\-path "  directory
specify a directory in which to place statd state information.
If this option is not specified the default of 
.BR /var/lib/nfs
is used.
.TP
.B -N
Causes statd to run in the notify-only mode. When started in this mode, the
statd program will check its state directory, send notifications to any
monitored nodes, and exit once the notifications have been sent. This mode is
used to enable Highly Available NFS implementations (i.e. HA-NFS).
.TP
.BI "\-H, " "" " \-\-ha-callout " prog
Specify a high availability callout program, which will receive callouts
for all client monitor and unmonitor requests. This allows
.B rpc.statd
to be used in a High Availability NFS (HA-NFS) environment. The
program will be run with 3 arguments:  The first is either
.B add-client
or
.B del-client
depending on the reason for the callout.
The second will be the name of the client.
The third will be the name of the server as known to the client.
.TP
.B -?
Causes
.B rpc.statd
to print out command-line help and exit.
.TP
.B -V
Causes
.B rpc.statd
to print out version information and exit.



.SH TCP_WRAPPERS SUPPORT
This
.B rpc.statd
version is protected by the
.B tcp_wrapper
library. You have to give the clients access to
.B rpc.statd
if they should be allowed to use it. To allow connects from clients of
the .bar.com domain you could use the following line in /etc/hosts.allow:

statd: .bar.com

You have to use the daemon name 
.B statd
for the daemon name (even if the binary has a different name).

For further information please have a look at the
.BR tcpd (8)
and
.BR hosts_access (5)
manual pages.

.SH SIGNALS
.BR SIGUSR1
causes
.B rpc.statd
to re-read the notify list from disk
and send notifications to clients. This can be used in High Availability NFS
(HA-NFS) environments to notify clients to reacquire file locks upon takeover
of an NFS export from another server.
