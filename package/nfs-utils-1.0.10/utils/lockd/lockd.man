.SH NAME
rpc.lockd \- start kernel lockd process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "/usr/sbin/rpc.lockd
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B rpc.lockd
program starts the NFS lock manager (NLM) on kernels that don't start
it automatically.  However, since most kernels \fIdo\fR start it
automatically,
.BR rpc.lockd .
is usually not required.  Even so, running it anyway is harmless.
