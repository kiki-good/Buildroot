 This is my port of nhfsstone to Linux. As a benchmark, it has been
 superseded by LADDIS (but unfortunately, LADDIS comes with a 1200 buck
 price tag), but it's quite good at catching NFS bugs :-)

 Of course, this port does not work with the old NFS client code, as
 it does not collect RPC stats.
