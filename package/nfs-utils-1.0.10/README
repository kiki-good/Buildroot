This is version 1.0.1 of nfs-utils, the Linux NFS utility package.


0. PROJECT RESOURCES

Home page:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/nfs/

To use the 'gss' support you must have kerberos-5 development 
libraries installed.
Otherwise use  "--disable-gss"

To use nfsv4 support you need libevent and libnfsidmap development
libraries.  They are available from 
   http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
   http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfsv4/linux/libnfsidmap/
Otherwise use --disable-nfsv4


1. COMPILING WITHOUT PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

To compile without using a package management system, unpack the
sources and run these commands:

    # ./configure
    # make

To install binaries and documenation, run this command:

    # make install

You will have to install the two NFS service scripts yourself.
Service scripts for RedHat 6.x and 7.x are in etc/redhat.  They
have been tested on RedHat 6.2 and 7.1.


2. COMPILING WITH RPM

On RedHat 6.2 and 7.1, you can use

    # rpm -ta nfs-utils-1.0.1.tar.gz

to build the source and binary RPMs.


3. COMPILING FOR DEBIAN

The nfs-utils tree has an up-to-date debian directory, so the usual
debian build scripts should work.  The simplest way to build binary
debs, however, is simply to become root (or use fakeroot) and run:

    # debian/rules binary


4. REQUIRED VERSIONS OF OTHER TOOLS

Proper NFS operation requires a 'mount' program from util-linux 2.11f
or later.


Share And Enjoy!
