.SH NAME
upstart\-dbus\-bridge \- Bridge between Upstart and D-Bus
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upstart\-dbus\-bridge
.RI [ OPTIONS ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B upstart\-dbus\-bridge
receives information about D-Bus signals
and creates
.BR init (8)
events for them.

With no options, monitors signals on the D-Bus system bus and emits
an Upstart event called
.I dbus
via a D-Bus system bus connection to Upstart.

When run with \fB\-\-user\fP, monitors signals on the users D-Bus session bus
and emits Upstart events via the private D-Bus connection to the users Session Init.

See \fBdbus\-daemon\fP(1) and for further details.
