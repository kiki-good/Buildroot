.SH NAME
startup \- event signalling system startup
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B startup
.RI [ ENV ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B startup
event is generated by the Upstart
.BR init (8)
daemon after it has completed its own initialisation and is the signal
that the rest of the system may be started.

Typically this will involve checking and mounting the partitions and
drives that form the filesystem, loading drivers for connected devices
and starting the X windowing system or other login environment.

In the default Upstart configuration, the primary task run on the
.B startup
event is the
.I /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf
job responsible for generating the System V compatible
.BR runlevel (7)
event.  See that page for a more detailed explanation of this process.

This event is emitted when running both as pid 1 and as a Session Init.

Paradoxically there is currently no corresponding Upstart-native event
signifying that the system is to be shutdown, only the System V compatible
.B runlevel 0
and
.B runlevel 6
events provide this functionality. However, when running as a Session
Init, the
.BR session\-end
event performs this function.
