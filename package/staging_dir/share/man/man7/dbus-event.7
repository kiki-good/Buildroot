.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B dbus
event is generated by the
.BR upstart\-dbus\-bridge (8)
daemon when a D-Bus signal is emitted whose details match the
.I dbus
event condition and environment specified in a job's
.B start on
or
.B stop on
stanza is modified.

Arguments that are simple types (string, int, etc.) are translated into strings and placed as parameters on the event with the pattern ARG and the number representing the placement in the event prototype.  Parameters that are not a simple type are skipped, with the number being incremented the same.

The
.B BUS
parameter is optional and only set if the
.BR upstart\-dbus\-bridge (8)
daemon is started with the
.B --bus-name
parameter.  The value of
.B BUS
will be the same as the value passed as the parameter.
