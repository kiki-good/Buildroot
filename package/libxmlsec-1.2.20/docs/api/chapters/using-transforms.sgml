    <title>Transforms and transforms chain.</title>
    <para>XML Digital Signature and XML Encryption standards are 
	very flexible and provide an XML developer many different ways to 
	sign or encrypt any part (or even parts) of an XML document. 
	The key for such great flexibility is the "transforms" model.
	Transform is defined as a method of pre-processing binary or XML data 
	before calculating digest or signature. XML Security Library extends 
	this definition and names "transform" any operation performed on 
	the data: reading data from an URI, xml parsing, xml transformation, 
	calculation digest, encrypting or decrypting. Each XML Security Library
	transform provides at least one of the following callbacks:

		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    <link linkend="xmlSecTransformPushXmlMethod">push xml data</link>;
		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    <link linkend="xmlSecTransformPopBinMethod">pop binary data</link>;
		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
		    <link linkend="xmlSecTransformPopXmlMethod">pop xml data</link>.
    		</para></listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>One additional <link linkend="xmlSecTransformExecuteMethod">execute</link>
	callback was added to simplify the development and reduce code size. 
	This callback is used by default
	implementations of the four external callbacks from the list above.
	For example, most of the crypto transforms could be implemented by 
	just implementing one "execute" callback and using default push/pop 
	binary data callbacks. However, in some cases using push/pop callbacks 
	directly is more efficient.

    <para>XML Security Library constructs transforms chain according to the 
	signature/encryption template or signed/encrypted document. 
	If necessary, XML Security Library inserts XML parser or defaul
	canonicalization to ensure that the output data type (binary or XML) 
	of previous transform matches the input of the next transform.
    </para>
    <para>The data are processed by pushing through or poping from the chain
	depending on the transforms in the chain.  For example, then binary 
	data chunk is pushed through a binary-to-binary transform, it 
	processes this chunk and pushes the result to the next transform 
	in the chain.
