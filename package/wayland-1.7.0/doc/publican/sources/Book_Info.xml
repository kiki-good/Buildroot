      Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to
      its clients as well as a C library implementation of
      that protocol. The compositor can be a standalone
      display server running on Linux kernel modesetting
      and evdev input devices, an X application, or a
      Wayland client itself. The clients can be
      traditional applications, X servers (rootless or
      fullscreen) or other display servers.
